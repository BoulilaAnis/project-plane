    Review: Begin the lesson by reviewing the key concepts of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript covered throughout the course. Reinforce important topics such as DOM manipulation, event handling, CSS styling, and game logic.

    Game Concept Selection: Allow each student to choose a game concept based on their interests. Encourage creativity and provide guidance if needed. The game could be a simple arcade game, a platformer, a puzzle game, or any other genre the student prefers.

    Game Design and Planning: Instruct the students to plan and design their game. This includes creating a visual mockup or sketch of the game layout, character designs, background images, and any other graphical elements they want to incorporate.

    HTML Structure: Assist the students in creating the basic HTML structure for their game. This includes setting up the necessary containers, game canvas, and any additional elements required for the game's interface.

    CSS Styling: Guide the students in applying CSS styles to their game. Emphasize the importance of good graphics and aesthetics. Help them with animations, transitions, and responsive design to enhance the visual appeal of their game.

    Game Logic and Interactivity: Help the students implement the game logic and interactivity using JavaScript. This may include handling user input, moving game characters, collision detection, keeping score, and managing game states (start screen, gameplay, game over, etc.).

    Graphics Integration: Assist the students in integrating graphics into their game. This includes adding background images, character sprites, item icons, and any other graphical assets they have designed or obtained from online resources.

    Testing and Debugging: Encourage the students to thoroughly test their game and identify any bugs or issues. Assist them in debugging their code and making necessary adjustments to ensure smooth gameplay.

    Refinement and Polish: Guide the students in adding final touches to their game. Help them optimize the graphics, improve game performance, and add any additional features or animations that enhance the overall experience.

    Present and Share: Allocate time for each student to present their game to the class. Encourage them to discuss their design choices, demonstrate gameplay, and highlight the technical aspects they are proud of.
